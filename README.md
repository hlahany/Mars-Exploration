# Mars_Exploration
The project is about exploratory missions that are carried out to different regions on Mars. We simulated the mission assignment process using object-oriented C++ programming and calculated some related statistics in order to help improve the overall process, then we output them in a text file.
You will find the project description document called "Project_Requirements".
You will find the used data structures in a docment called "Chosen_ADTs"
